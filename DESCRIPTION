Title: Spatio-Dynamic Wetland Plant Communities Model
Description: A spatio-dynamic modelling package that focuses on three
    characteristic wetland plant communities in a semiarid Mediterranean
    wetland in response to hydrological pressures from the catchment. The
    package includes the data on watershed hydrological pressure and the
    initial raster maps of plant communities but also allows for random initial
    distribution of plant communities. Ongoing developments of the package
    focus on offering easy to use tools for creating other spatio-dynamic
    models.
